Please run "ReadFile filename" in your command prompt or powershell. 
The app assumes it will be a *.txt file and is not configured to work with other file types.

For example..
"ReadFile numbers"

You may need elevated privileges to run the exe. In powershell you may need to use .\ before the command name ie
.\Readfile numbers
